Welcome to the first Hackathon for CTE 2018

This Hackathon is not graded. Though the winner will get a Sandisk 16GB Pendrive (Which I think is pretty cool!)

Rules for the Hackathon:

1) Every kind of Malpractice is allowed and is encouraged.
2) Physically disturbing / violence anyone is not allowed.
3) Finally you’ll be checked on the website look alike, you are encouraged to use the code of anyone who has submitted early (Why would anyone do that though?).
4) You cannot check instructor’s code during hackathon.

So, now that this is done. Happy hacking!
